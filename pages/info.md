Jeff Matney has been hunting since the age of 6 and started guiding professionally at 18.

Jeff has a great passion for the outdoors and spends any free time he has traveling the world experiencing local fishing and hunting cultures.
Jeff has been professionally guiding for 13 years.  He is a straight forward guy with no BS, meaning he's realistic and won't try to oversell a hunt.
Jeff has an expert understanding of a species' interaction with geography and terrain.  In other words, he knows where to find the animals!
Its not just hunting, but an understanding of animal behavior.

Jeff also enjoys hunting for himself, doing his own taxidermy, long range shooting, archery, and teaching others.
